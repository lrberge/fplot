\arguments{
\item{fml}{A formula or a vector. If a formula, it must be of the type:
\code{weights ~ var | moderator}. If there are no moderator nor weights, you
can use directly a vector, or use a one-sided formula \code{fml = ~var}. You
can use multiple variables as weights, if so, you cannot use moderators at the
same time. See examples.}

\item{data}{A data.frame: data set containing the variables in the formula.}

\item{moderator}{Optional, only if argument \code{fml} is a vector. A vector
of moderators.}

\item{weight}{Optional, only if argument \code{fml} is a vector. A vector of
(positive) weights.}

\item{sorted}{Logical: should the first elements displayed be the most frequent?
By default this is the case except for numeric values put to log or to integers.}

\item{log}{Logical, only used when the data is numeric. If \code{TRUE}, then
the data is put to logarithm beforehand. By default numeric values are put to
log if the log variation exceeds 3.}

\item{nbins}{Maximum number of items displayed. The default depends on the number
of moderator cases. When there is no moderator, the default is 15, augmented
to 20 if there are less than 20 cases.}

\item{bin.size}{Only used for numeric values. If provided, it creates bins of
observations of size \code{bin.size}. It creates bins by default for numeric non-integer data.}

\item{legend_options}{A list. Other options to be passed to \code{legend} which
concerns the legend for the moderator.}

\item{top}{What to display on the top of the bars. Can be equal to "frac" (for
shares), "nb" or "none". The default depends on the type of the plot. To disable
it you can also set it to \code{FALSE} or the empty string.}

\item{yaxis.show}{Whether the y-axis should be displayed, default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{yaxis.num}{Whether the y-axis should display regular numbers instead of
frequencies in percentage points. By default it shows numbers only when the data
is weighted with a different function than the sum. For conditionnal distributions,
a numeric y-axis can be displayed only when \code{mod.method = "sideTotal"},
\code{mod.method = "splitTotal"} or \code{mod.method = "stack"}, since for the
within distributions it does not make sense (because the data is rescaled for each moderator).}

\item{col}{A vector of colors, default is close to paired. You can also use \dQuote{set1}
or \dQuote{paired}.}

\item{border}{Outer color of the bars. Defaults is \code{"black"}. Use \code{NA}
to remove the borders.}

\item{mod.method}{A character scalar: either i) \dQuote{split}, the default for
categorical data, ii) \dQuote{side}, the default for data in logarithmic form
or numeric data, or iii) \dQuote{stack}. This is only used when there is more
Ã¹ than one moderator. If \code{"split"}: there is one separate histogram for each
moderator case. If \code{"side"}: moderators are represented side by side for
each value of the variable. If \code{"stack"}: the bars of the moderators are
stacked onto each other, the bar heights representing the distribution in the
total population. You can use the other arguments \code{within} and \code{total}
to say whether the distributions should be within each moderator or over the
total distribution.}

\item{within}{Logical, default is missing. Whether the distributions should be
scaled to reflect the distribution within each moderator value. By default it
is \code{TRUE} if \code{mod.method} is different from \code{"stack"}.}

\item{total}{Logical, default is missing. Whether the distributions should be
scaled to reflect the total distribution (and not the distribution within each
moderator value). By default it is \code{TRUE} only if \code{mod.method="stack"}.}

\item{mod.select}{Which moderators to select. By default the top 3 moderators
in terms of frequency (or in terms of weight value if there's a weight) are displayed.
If provided, it must be a vector of moderator values whose length cannot be greater
than 5. Alternatively, you can put an integer between 1 and 5. This argument
also accepts regular expressions.}

\item{mod.NA}{Logical, default is \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, and if the moderator
contains \code{NA} values, all \code{NA} values from the moderator will be treated
as a regular case: allows to display the distribution for missing values.}

\item{at_5}{Equal to \code{FALSE}, \code{"roman"} or \code{"line"}. When plotting
categorical variables, adds a small Roman number under every 5 bars
(\code{at_5 = "roman"}), or draws a thick axis line every 5 bars (\code{at_5 = "line"}).
Helps to get the rank of the bars. The default depends on the type of data --
Not implemented when there is a moderator.}

\item{labels.tilted}{Whether there should be tilted labels. Default is \code{FALSE}
except when the data is split by moderators (see \code{mod.method}).}

\item{other}{Logical. Should there be a last column counting for the observations
not displayed? Default is \code{TRUE} except when the data is split.}

\item{cumul}{Logical, default is \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, then the cumulative
distribution is plotted.}

\item{plot}{Logical, default is \code{TRUE}. If \code{FALSE} nothing is plotted,
only the data is returned.}

\item{sep}{Positive number. The separation space between the bars. The scale
depends on the type of graph.}

\item{centered}{Logical, default is \code{TRUE}. For numeric data only and when
\code{sorted=FALSE}, whether the histogram should be centered on the mode.}

\item{weight.fun}{A function, by default it is \code{sum}. Aggregate function
to be applied to the weight with respect to variable and the moderator. See examples.}

\item{int.categorical}{Logical. Whether integers should be treated as categorical
variables. By default they are treated as categorical only when their range is
small (i.e. smaller than 1000).}

\item{dict}{A dictionnary to rename the variables names in the axes and legend.
Should be a named vector. By default it s the value of \code{getFplot_dict()},
which you can set with the function \code{\link[fplot]{setFplot_dict}}.}

\item{mod.title}{Character scalar. The title of the legend in case there is a
moderator. You can set it to \code{TRUE} (the default) to display the moderator
name. To display no title, set it to \code{NULL} or \code{FALSE}.}

\item{labels.angle}{Only if the labels of the x-axis are tilted. The angle of the tilt.}

\item{cex.axis}{Cex value to be passed to biased labels. By defaults, it finds
automatically the right value.}

\item{trunc}{If the main variable is a character, its values are truncaded to
\code{trunc} characters. Default is 20. You can set the truncation method with
the argument \code{trunc.method}.}

\item{trunc.method}{If the elements of the x-axis need to be truncated, this
is the truncation method. It can be "auto", "right" or "mid".}

\item{...}{Other elements to be passed to plot.}
}
\value{
This function returns \emph{invisibly} the output data.table containing the processed data
used for plotting. With the argument \code{plot = FALSE}, only the data is returned.
}
\description{
This function plots distributions of items (a bit like an histogram) which can
be easily conditioned over.
}
\details{
Most default values can be modified with the function \code{\link[fplot]{setFplot_distr}}.

\examples{

# Data on publications from U.S. institutions
data(us_pub_econ)

# 0) Let's set a dictionary for a better display of variables
setFplot_dict(c(institution = "U.S. Institution", jnl_top_25p = "Top 25\% Pub.",
                jnl_top_5p = "Top 5\% Pub.", Frequency = "Publications"))

# 1) Let's plot the distribution of publications by institutions:
plot_distr(~institution, us_pub_econ)

# When there is only the variable, you can use a vector instead:
plot_distr(us_pub_econ$institution)

# 2) Now the production of institution weighted by journal quality
plot_distr(jnl_top_5p ~ institution, us_pub_econ)

# You can plot several variables:
plot_distr(1 + jnl_top_25p + jnl_top_5p ~ institution, us_pub_econ)

# 3) Let's plot the journal distribution for the top 3 institutions

# We can get the data from the previous graph
graph_data = plot_distr(jnl_top_5p ~ institution, us_pub_econ, plot = FALSE)
# And then select the top universities
top3_instit = graph_data$x[1:3]
top5_instit = graph_data$x[1:5] # we'll use it later

# Now the distribution of journals
plot_distr(~ journal | institution, us_pub_econ[institution \%in\% top3_instit])
# Alternatively, you can use the argument mod.select:
plot_distr(~ journal | institution, us_pub_econ, mod.select = top3_instit)

# 3') Same graph as before with "other" column, 5 institutions
plot_distr(~ journal | institution, us_pub_econ,
           mod.select = top5_instit, other = TRUE)

#
# Example with continuous data
#

# regular histogram
plot_distr(iris$Sepal.Length)

# now splitting by species:
plot_distr(~ Sepal.Length | Species, iris)

# idem but the three distr. are separated:
plot_distr(~ Sepal.Length | Species, iris, mod.method = "split")

# Now the three are stacked
plot_distr(~ Sepal.Length | Species, iris, mod.method = "stack")
