\title{Aggregate/conditional graphs and automatic layout using formulas}
\description{
\pkg{fplot} provides automatic plotting of common graphs (distributions, lines, bar plots and boxplots). The syntax uses formulas, allowing aggregate/conditional/weighted graphs with minimum efforts. The many arguments are automatically adjusted to the data in order to provide the nicest and most meaningful graphs.
}
\details{
The core functions is \code{\link[fplot]{plot_distr}} to draw distributions.
Two other graphical functions are provided for convenience: \code{\link[fplot]{plot_lines}} to represent the (usually temporal) evolution of some variables, and \code{\link[fplot]{plot_box}} to easily represent conditional boxplots.

It also integrates tools to easily export graphs: \code{\link[fplot]{pdf_fit}} and \code{\link[fplot]{png_fit}}. In these functions, instead of providing the size of the graphics, you instead give the point size that the text should have in the final document--because an exported graph usually ends up in a document. You can set the size of your document with the function \code{\link[fplot]{setFplot_page}}. If you use the function \code{\link[fplot]{fit.off}} to close the connection, you will also see how the export looks like in the Viewer pane.
